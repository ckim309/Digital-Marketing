# Digital-Marketing

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to use data from a t-shirt selling company to understand how well their product is being sold on 3 digital marketing channels by using data from February 2016 to April 2019. In this project, we’ll assume that April 2019 is the present day.


## Summary of Analysis

There are 3 digital marketing channels that are used to sell t-shirts, Google, Facebook, and Twitter. From the 3 digital marketing channels, the advertisements shown on Google performed the best, then Twitter, and lastly Facebook, in 2018. However, compared to the previous year, the digital marketing channels performed poorly in selling t-shirts. It’s forecasted that by the end of 2019, the net profit will be lower than 2018. In order to prevent this, the company should look to resolve 2 key factors. First, the number of conversions on Facebook is forecasted to decrease by 32.4%, resulting in a loss in revenue. Counter actions need to be made, such as reallocating resources into another digital market. Second, customers are spending, on average, less on the product across all digital markets. However, it appears that they are interested in the product, due to the consistent CTR. Since all the digital markets are being affected, the company should look into seeing if a new competition emerged or look to see if there is a macro-level trend that is happening, such as the economy.
