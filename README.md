# Digital-Marketing

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to use data from a t-shirt selling company to understand how well their product is being sold on 3 digital marketing channels by using data from February 2016 to April 2019. In this project, weâ€™ll assume that April 2019 is the present day.


## Summary of Analysis

Customers from all 3 digital marketing channels are spending less, on average, but are interested in the t-shirt products. Since all 3 digital marketing channels generated less revenue than the previous year, it may be a global issue, such as the economy, that affected the average order value. However, since it is forecasted that the average order value is going to decrease more the following year, pricing adjustment plans or cost cutting measures may be necessary. 

Also, the marketing campaign from Facebook experienced a breakeven point. As a study has shown that the popularity of Facebook is declining, a more popular digital marketing platform that is targeted towards a younger audience, such as TikTok, Reddit, or Instagram, should be looked into.
